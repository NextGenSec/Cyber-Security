# Deploying A Vulnerability Scanner

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, staying one step ahead of potential security threats is essential. Vulnerability scanners are powerful tools designed to identify and assess weaknesses in your network, applications, and systems.

### Why Use a Vulnerability Scanner?

Vulnerability scanners play a crucial role in proactive cybersecurity by:

• Detecting Vulnerabilities: They pinpoint weaknesses that malicious actors could exploit to compromise your digital assets.

• Risk Assessment: They help prioritize security efforts by evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities.

• Compliance: Many regulatory standards require regular vulnerability assessments.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of deploying a vulnerability scanner, enabling you to fortify your digital defenses and maintain a robust security posture. Let's get started!

# Step 1: Download Windows 10 Image
1. Visit Microsoft's Official Download Page(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

2. Download the Media Creation Tool: Click on the "Download now" option on the Microsoft website to obtain the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.

3. Open the Media Creation Tool: Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file and open it.

4. Accept License Terms: In the tool, accept the license terms and conditions.

5. Choose Installation Media: Select "Create installation media (USB drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC" and click "Next."

6. Select Language and Edition: Choose your preferred language and edition settings for Windows 10 and click "Next."

7. Select Architecture: Decide between 32-bit and 64-bit architecture (usually 64-bit for modern systems) and click "Next."

8. Select ISO File: Choose the option to create an ISO file. Specify a directory where you want to save the ISO file, and click "Save."

9. Wait for Download: The tool will download the official Windows 10 image from Microsoft. The duration depends on your internet connection; it may take several minutes.
   
10. Completion: Once the download is complete, you'll have the Windows 10 image in ISO format ready for further use.

# Windows 10 Installation in VirtualBox

## Getting Started

1. **Open VirtualBox**: Launch the VirtualBox application on your computer. If you don't already have it installed, you can download it here(https://www.virtualbox.org/)

2. **Create a New Virtual Machine**: Click on the "New" button in VirtualBox to create a new virtual machine.

3. **Configure Virtual Machine Settings**:

   - **Name and Folder**: Give your virtual machine an appropriate name (e.g., "Nessus") and choose a folder location to store its files.
   - **Memory (RAM)**: Allocate an appropriate amount of memory to the virtual machine. It is recommended to assign at least 4GB of RAM for Windows 10, but you can allocate more if your system allows.
   - **Processor (CPU)**: Choose the number of CPUs for the virtual machine. The more CPUs you allocate, the faster the virtual machine will run. Typically, two CPUs are sufficient.
   - **Hard Disk**: Create a virtual hard disk with an appropriate size. The minimum recommended size is 25GB, but you can choose a larger size (e.g., 50GB) for better performance.

4. **Select ISO Image**: In the virtual machine creation wizard, you'll be prompted to select the ISO image for Windows 10. Click on the option to select the ISO image you downloaded earlier from Microsoft.

5. **Unattended Installation (Optional)**: You have the option to skip the unattended installation process. If you choose to skip, you'll need to manually configure installation settings like language, time zone, and user accounts during the Windows setup. Unattended installation allows you to configure these settings in advance for automatic installation.

6. **Configure Unattended Guest Install**: If you opt for unattended installation, you'll need to specify your username, password, domain name, and hostname for the Windows 10 setup. Make sure to remember these details as they will be used later.

7. **Guest Additions**: Select the option to install Guest Additions. This allows you to change the resolution and enables clipboard sharing between the virtual machine and your host system.

8. **Hardware Configuration**: Review and confirm the hardware settings, including memory, CPUs, and disk size. Make any necessary adjustments.

9. **Finish Virtual Machine Creation**: Click "Next" and then "Finish" to create the virtual machine.

10. **Start Installation**: VirtualBox will automatically start the virtual machine and initiate the Windows 10 installation process. If you chose unattended installation, it will proceed automatically. If not, follow the on-screen prompts during the Windows setup.

11. **Wait for Installation**: The installation process may take around 10 to 15 minutes to complete, depending on your computer's performance. You can take a break or make a coffee while it installs.

12. **Install Guest Additions (If Needed)**: After the Windows installation, if you encounter issues with Guest Additions, manually install them by navigating to the "Devices" tab in VirtualBox and clicking on "Insert Guest Additions CD image." Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

Once you've completed these steps, your Windows 10 environment in VirtualBox should be ready for further configuration and project setup, such as installing the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, as mentioned in the video transcript.

Happy virtualizing!
